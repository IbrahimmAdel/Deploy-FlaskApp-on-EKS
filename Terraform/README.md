Terraform Infrastructure Deployment Documentation

This document provides detailed instructions for deploying infrastructure using Terraform. The project consists of four modules: `ec2`, `ecr`, `eks`, and `network`. The goal is to create an environment that includes an EC2 instance for Jenkins, an ECR repository, an EKS cluster with worker nodes, and a network infrastructure with subnets and NAT gateways.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed (`terraform --version`).
- AWS credentials and CLI configured.
- Basic understanding of Terraform and AWS services.

## Module Overview

### EC2 Module

The EC2 module creates an EC2 instance to host Jenkins.

### ECR Module

The ECR module creates an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository for Docker images.

### EKS Module

The EKS module creates an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with worker nodes.

### Network Module

The Network module creates a network infrastructure with subnets and NAT gateways.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd terraform-project/
Initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Review and adjust variables:

Open the variables.tf files in each module directory and adjust variables as needed.
Deploy the infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Destroy the infrastructure (when done):

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
